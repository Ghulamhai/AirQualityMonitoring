# AirQualityMonitoring
This project is an IoT-based air quality monitoring system built on the ESP32 microcontroller. It measures CO₂, CO, CH₄, PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10, temperature, and humidity using MQ135, MQ9, PMS5003, and DHT22 sensors. The system logs data to Firebase Realtime Database and provides a web interface for real-time visualization.
